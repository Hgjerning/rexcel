#Frequently Asked Questions

=== I get an error when I try to read an xlsx file ===

If you just installed the package, make sure you have the dependent package *rJava* installed properly.  To check that, do 
{{{
require(rJava)
.jcall('java.lang.System','S','getProperty','java.version')
}}}
If you don't get back a string with your java version, it means your *rJava* package is not installed correctly.  You will need to fix this before you can use the *xlsx* package.   

=== I'm running out of java heap space when using write.xlsx ===

This is probably the complaint I get most from users.  It happens when you try to write a large `data.frame` to file.  What large means depends on your machine.  Unfortunately, I don't understand why so much memory is used when writing.  If you run into problems, you can try to increase the amount of java heap space that `R` allocates before you load the package. 
{{{
options(java.parameters="-Xmx1024m")
require(xlsx)
}}}
The default is `512m`, 512 MB.  If your computer has more RAM, increase it more and it may solve your problem.
