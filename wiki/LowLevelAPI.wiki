#summary Low-level API description.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" /> 

Using the low-level functions give you the ability to control what you read into R or what and how you export to a spreadsheet.  

= To create a spreadsheet from scratch = 

You have some data in `R` that you want to export to Excel.  Here are the steps you need to follow.  These steps mimic the Apache POI approach adapted to `R`. 

Create an empty workbook 
{{{
wb <- createWorkbook(type="xlsx")
}}} 
The workbook object `wb` is just a java reference.  You now need to add a sheet to it. 

Use
{{{
sheet <- createSheet(wb, sheetName="Sheet1")
}}} 
to add a sheet.  Now your workbook contains an empty sheet.  The next step is to create some rows to the sheet. 

To create 20 rows use 
{{{
rows <- createRow(sheet, rowIndex=1:20)
}}}

== Create cells == 

== Customize cell appearance ==

You can customize the appearance of content programatically by constructing a `CellStyle` object and then setting it to a given `Cell`.  

{{{
CellStyle()
}}}
