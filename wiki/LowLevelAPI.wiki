Using the low-level functions give you the ability to control what you read into R or what and how you export to a spreadsheet.

You have some data in R that you want to export to Excel.  Here are the steps you need to follow.

=== Create a workbook ===

Use 
{{{
wb <- createWorkbook(type="xlsx")
}}} 

to create an empty workbook.  The workbook object `wb` is just a java reference.  You now need to add a sheet to it. 

=== Create a sheet === 

Use
{{{
sheet <- createSheet(wb, sheetName="Sheet1")
}}}

Now your workbook contains an empty sheet.  The next step is to create some rows to the sheet.
