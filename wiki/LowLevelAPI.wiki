#summary Low-level API description.

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" /> 

Using the low-level functions gives you the ability to control what you read into R or what and how you export to a spreadsheet.  

= To create a spreadsheet from scratch = 

You have some data in `R` that you want to export to Excel.  Here are the steps you need to follow.  These steps mimic the Apache POI approach but made idiomatic to `R`. 

== General steps == 

Create an empty workbook 
{{{
wb <- createWorkbook(type="xlsx")
}}} 
The workbook object `wb` is just a java reference.  You now need to add a sheet to it. 

Use
{{{
sheet <- createSheet(wb, sheetName="Sheet1")
}}} 
to add a sheet.  Now your workbook contains an empty sheet.  The next step is to add some rows to the sheet. 

For example, to create 12 rows use 
{{{
rows <- createRow(sheet, rowIndex=1:12)
}}}
By now, you should suspect that the rows are empty, that is they have no cells. 

To create 10 cells in each row do   
{{{
cells <- createCell(rows, colIndex=1:10)
}}}
Now your sheet has 20x10 empty cells.  Variable `cells` is an `R` matrix of java references.  

For example, to populate the first column with the names of the month do
{{{
mapply(setCellValue, cells[1:12,1], month.name)
}}}
To set only one cell
{{{
setCellValue(cells[[2,2]], "I'm a special cell!")
}}}

To save your workbook to a file 
{{{
saveWorkbook(wb, file="/tmp/test.xlsx")
}}}

You are now done!  The function `write.xlsx` follows the steps above. 

== Customize cell appearance ==

You can customize the appearance of content programatically by constructing a `CellStyle` object and then setting it to a given `Cell`.  

{{{
CellStyle()
}}}
