#summary Comments about the package and this project.

This project grew from a need I had, and I decided to make the package public in order to help other users too.  

If you are interested in this project and you want to report a bug, request a feature, or just want to follow the development, please join the Google group *R-package-xlsx* [http://groups.google.com/group/r-package-xlsx].  

I have limited time to help with direct questions, so I hope that by organizing a community of users, we can all help each other.  Please use the Issues list to report bugs, take the time to read the documentation and the Wikis, and suggest improvements.
